\section{Overview of the Protocol}

\begin{lemma}
  Suppose we have a set $A \subseteq [N]$ which is known to all players, and a set $A_i \subseteq A$ that is known to some player $i \in [k]$.
  Let $m, n \in \nat$ be such that $m \leq |A| \leq n$, and assume further that $|A_i| \leq |A|/m$.
  Then there is a deterministic protocol where only player $i$ speaks,
  that allows all players to learn a set $B \subseteq A \setminus A_i$
  of size $|B| \geq m/2$,
  using $\log n$ bits of communication.
  \label{lemma:reveal_zeroes}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Fix in advance a partition of $A$ into sets $B_1,\ldots,B_{\ell}$,
  where $|B_j| = m/2$ for each $j = 1,\ldots,\ell-1$,
  and the last set has size $m/2 \leq B_{\ell} \leq m - 1$.
  Note that we have $\ell > |A_i|$: \newline
  each $B_j$ comprises $m/2$ elements, therefore:
  \begin{equation*}
    \ell \geq \frac{|A|}{m/2} - 1
  \end{equation*}
  
  Simplifying the expression and using $A_i$'s size assumption:
  \begin{equation*}
    \frac{|A|}{m/2} - 1 =  2\frac{|A|}{m} - 1 > \frac{|A|}{m} \geq |A_i|.
  \end{equation*}
   
  
  Therefore, there exists $j \in [\ell]$ such that $B_j \cap A_i = \emptyset$:
  assume by contradiction that $A_i$ intersects all $\ell$ sets $B_1,\ldots,B_{\ell}$. 
  \begin{equation*}
  |A_i| = |\bigcup_{j=1}^{\ell}\left(B_j \cap A_i \right)| \geq \sum_{j=1}^{\ell} |B_j \cap A_i| \geq \sum_{j=1}^{\ell}1 = \ell
  \end{equation*}

  The protocol is therefore to have player $i$ send the index $j \in [\ell]$ of a set $B_j$
  such that $A_i \cap B_j = \emptyset$.
  The requirements are satisfied: we have $B_j \subseteq A \setminus A_i$,
  and $|B_j| \geq m / 2$.
  Specifying the index $j$ requires $\log \ell \leq \log n$ bits.
  
\end{proof}



\subsection{Overview of the Protocol}
Throughout the protocol, we maintain a \emph{universe}, $U \subseteq [N]$,
with the property that $\bigcap_i x_i \subseteq U$.
Initially, $U = [N]$.

The protocol operates in \emph{iterations}, where each iteration has two possible outcomes:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We eliminate at least a $1/\Theta(|U|^{1/k})$-fraction of elements from $U$
  \item We halt and guess 0 as the answer. This output is not always correct, but it is correct with high probability over the inputs.
\end{enumerate}
The protocol operates in iterations until the universe is small enough ($|U| < N^{\frac{1}{k}}$). This happens after at most $4N^{1 - 1/k}$ iterations. At this point each player $i$ shares his input $x_i \cap U$,
and the players calculate the exact answer and output it (output 1 iff $\bigcap_{i = 1}^k (x_i \cap U) = \emptyset$). \newline
\newline
Let us dive in to the method to eliminate a significant fraction of elements from the universe.
