# Communication Complexity Thesis Work

## Key Documents
- Main proof draft: @Disj-CC.pdf
- Related paper: @stoc21.pdf
- LaTeX source: @Disj-CC.tex

## Project Structure
- `thesis-work/` - Contain the main working directory in which we will write the thesis document
- `examples/` - Contains example code and proofs

## Important Notes
- The thesis focuses on Communication Complexity
- Latex files sit in `thesis-work/`
- Build system uses latexmk (evidenced by .fdb_latexmk file)

## Common Tasks
1. Editing the main thesis:
   - Edit different tex files in `thesis-work\` using the ideas from `Disj-CC.tex`
   - Build using latexmk
   - Check output in `thesis-work\thesis.pdf`

2. Referencing the STOC paper:
   - Use `stoc21.pdf` for reference
   - Cite in LaTeX using appropriate citation key

## Build Process
The thesis is built using latexmk, which generates several auxiliary files:
- `.aux` - Auxiliary information
- `.log` - Build log
- `.out` - PDF bookmarks and links
- `.fls` - File list
- `.fdb_latexmk` - latexmk database

## Version Control
- Git repository initialized
- `.gitignore` configured for LaTeX build artifacts
