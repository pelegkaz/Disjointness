I would like to thank my advisors, Rotem Oshman and Uri Zwick, for their patience, their dedicated guidance and insights. I would also like to thank my colleges in Finland - Jukka Suomela, Tuomo Lempi√§inen, Joel Rybicki, and Juho Hirvonen , and my colleges in Switzerland - Roger Wattenhofer, Sebastian Brandt, Barbara Keller and Jara Uitto, for introducing me to the world of distributed, for hosting me at their universities and for sharing with me their interesting research. And finally, I would like to thank to my loving parents and sister, for which this thesis is dedicated to.
