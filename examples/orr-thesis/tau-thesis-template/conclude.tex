\section{Conclusion}
In this work we extended the classical results of Babai and Kimmel~\cite{BK97} to the multi-player setting,
and gave a tight bound for the gap between private-coin and deterministic communication complexity
in the simultaneous setting.
We showed that contrary to our initial expectations, the gap does not grow larger with the number of players,
and indeed the per-player gap can shrink as the number of players grows.
We also addressed a class of functions defined by taking a two-party function and asking whether there are two players
whose inputs cause it to output 1.

Our work leaves open the interesting question of simultaneous lower bounds for the model considered in~\cite{AGM12,BMNRST14,BPRT14},
where each player represents a node in a graph and is given the edges adjacent to that node.
Our techniques do not apply to this scenario because of the sharing of edges between players.
Indeed, the connectivity problem for this model (see~\cite{OpenProblem65}) cannot be addressed by reductions from two-player communication complexity,
because it is easy for two players: 
we can simply have Alice and Bob compute spanning forests for their part of the input and send them to each other,
at a total cost of $O(n \log n)$.
Thus, further multi-party techniques need to be developed to address the hardness of connectivity.
